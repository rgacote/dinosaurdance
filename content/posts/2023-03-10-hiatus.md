A short break while I return to the land of Python and ReportLab PDF generation.
This is my first time using the commercial ReportLab PLUS markup language (RML).
Already have about 1,500 lines of RML generating multi-hundred page reports.

I'll be doing some reading homework with the [early release version](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition) of Elixir in Action, Third Edition by Saša Jurić.

Plan to be back in April.
