Sticking with Dave Thomas for the moment and starting the Elixir for Programmers, Second Edition [course](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers-2).
I'm expecting that much of this will be a refresher on what I've already covered, along with a first foray into Phoenix LiveView.

The LiveView will be a bit outdated given the recent major LiveView improvements, but mostly I'm looking for solid Elixir coding exercises.

I have a first project in mind, which does not require LiveView.
Plan to start the project after I finish this course.

Worked exercises will be available in my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/rgacote/Elixir4Programmers2ndExercises).
