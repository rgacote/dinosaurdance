The Coding Gnome [Elixir course](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers-2)
is the most fun I've ever had with a programming course.

The course focuses primarily on how to structure an Elixir application.
It explores isolating components into various agents and servers.
Recommend you have at least some basic experience with Elixir before starting.

Dave moves right along and I found myself frequently rewinding and reviewing many a video.
I found that typing along helped my comprehension.

I did just watch the two final Phoenix-related chapters as Phoenix has changed significantly since the course was recorded.
Skipping made sense as my first planned project is not Phoenix-based and I know there's Phoenix-related courses being updated right now.

So, 4.5 out of 5 stars for this course (the .5 being Phoenix in need of updates).

I'm pretty sure my first several projects are going to have an architecture that looks quite similar to Hangman
and that I'll be referring to the sample code and course regularly over the next year.
