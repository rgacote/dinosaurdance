I've selected a small Elixir project to write between wrapping up one Python project and starting on the next.
The SimpleCardBin project will return the bank-card type based on the first six digits in the card.

A quick [hex.pm](hex.pm) search found packages that return more detailed information, but I didn't find anything that ran without calling a web service.

I like this for a quick project as it can easily be done in a LiveBook and it primarily relies on function parameter pattern matching.

Let's see where I am in a few days.
