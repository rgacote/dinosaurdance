That's the question Francesco Cesarini, founder of [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/) has asked of dozens of language inventors.
He said that José Valim was the first person whose reply included a "focus…on the adoption of ides, semantics, and runtime of another extremely powerful language, Erlang."

What problem were the Erlang co-inventors trying to solve?
They sought to "efficiently build and maintain scalable, fault-tolerant systems."

Francesco's belief is that you need to understand both Erlang and OTP to truly understand Elixir.

Saša Jurić's preface references his [The Evangelist](http://theerlangelist.com) blog, which will keep me busy for awhile;
particularly the six-part "Understanding Macros."
