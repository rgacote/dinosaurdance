My Python-brain still sees `TodoList.add_entry(todo_list, new_entry)` as some object call and not a function to modify `todo_list`.

Additionally, when inside a GenServer `cast` or `call` I'm thinking, "Where did the `todo_list` come from?"
It came from the GenServer and is the GenServer's state.

Brain is slowly switching to functional mode.
