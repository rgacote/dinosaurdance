An Elixir behaviour is a list of functions a module is expected to implement.


<!--more-->

1. A behaviour module is a bit like an abstract base class.

1. Use `@callback` to declare a function that must be defined.

1. Behaviours can have a mix of callbacks and implemented functions.

1. `@callback` declares the parameters and the return type.

1. Behaviours document and enforce the public functions that must be implemented.
