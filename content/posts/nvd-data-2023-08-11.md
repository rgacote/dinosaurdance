I took a short side trip to toss together some Python
[scripts](https://github.com/Appropriate-Solutions-Inc/nvd-data)
that download and massage the CVE data from the NIST/NVD website.

These are throw-away scripts as the NIST batch [data feed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds)
is being 'retired' in December 2023.

I now have 20+ years of easily updatable CVE reports archived.
This data will eventually populate the initial Mnesia database.
Long term, the CacheNVD project will need to use the NVD's web service API to obtain changes and additions.

Now to get back to my Mnesia reading.
