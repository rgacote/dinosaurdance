I tossed together some Python [scripts](https://github.com/Appropriate-Solutions-Inc/nvd-data)
that download and massage the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) data from the NIST/NVD website.

These are throw-away scripts as NIST is 'retiring' the batch [data feed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) in December 2023.

I now have 20+ years of easily updatable CVE reports archived with which to populate a Mnesia database.
Long term, the CacheNVD project will use the NVD's web service API to obtain changes and additions.

Now to get back to my Mnesia reading.
