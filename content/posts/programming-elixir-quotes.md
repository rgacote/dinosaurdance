[Programming Elixir ≥1.6: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/) by Dave Thomas.


Some quotes I found particularly interesting, insightful, or inspiring.

“But mostly, I want you to have fun.”

“…you can think about programming in a different way.”

“You no longer have to think too hard about protecting your data consistency in a multithreaded environment.”

“I don’t want to hide data. I want to transform it.”
<!--more-->

“You’re going to have to unlearn a whole lot of what you know about programming.
Many of your instincts will be wrong.
And this will be frustrating, because you’re going to feel like a total n00b.”

“In Elixir, the equals sign is not an assignment.
Instead it’s like an assertion.”

“Immutable Data Is Known Data”

“you should always use parentheses around function parameters in pipelines.”

“every programmer is a library writer.”

“In Elixir we write lots of small functions, and a combination of guard
clauses and pattern matching of parameters replaces most of the
control flow seen in other languages.”

“Elixir exceptions are intended for things that should never happen in normal operation”

“Elixir developers are so comfortable creating new processes,
they’ll often do it at times when you’d have created an object in a language such as Java.”

“Beam, <... is> like its own little operating system running on top of your host operating system”
