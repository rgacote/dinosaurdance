[Programming Elixir ≥1.6: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/) by Dave Thomas.

“But mostly, I want you to have fun.”

“…you can think about programming in a different way.”

“You no longer have to think too hard about protecting your data consistency in a multithreaded environment.”

“I don’t want to hide data. I want to transform it.”

“You’re going to have to unlearn a whole lot of what you know about programming.
Many of your instincts will be wrong.
And this will be frustrating, because you’re going to feel like a total n00b.”

“In Elixir, the equals sign is not an assignment.
Instead it’s like an assertion.”

“Immutable Data Is Known Data”
