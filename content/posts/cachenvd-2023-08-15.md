[Importing](https://github.com/Appropriate-Solutions-Inc/cachenvd/blob/v0.0.1/lib/cachenvd/CLI/csv_loader.ex)
a .csv file using [NimbleCSV](https://hexdocs.pm/nimble_csv/NimbleCSV.html)

An article by Jacob Swanner [NimbleCSV: Parsing into Elixir Maps](https://jacobswanner.com/development/2022/nimble-csv-maps/)
filled in some gaps in the official documentation.

<!--more-->

Jacob's article shows how to return the list of maps for further processing.

Now that I have a better understanding of how the parsing occurs, I'll likely use the `Stream.run` style
of the official documentation in my final code.
That should allow me to stream the data out of the file and into the Mnesia data store.

Example data file:
```text
cve_id,cve
CVE-2011-0001,"{""cve"": {""data_type"": ... ""2023-02-13T03:22Z""}"
```
