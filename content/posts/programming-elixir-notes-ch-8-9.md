Chapter 8 is a dense chapter on an extremely useful set of features.
Will become a reference chapter when starting to build Elixir projects as I'm very used to using maps, structs, etc.

Chapter 9 is a quick aside on types.

Neither chapter has exercises.

1) You can only have one struct per module.

1) Different syntax for updating a key's value and adding a key.


_All notes and comments are my own opinion._
