Wow, almost a year since my last post.

I learned three things from my first attempt to learn Elixir.

1. Cool language!

1. Cool community!

1. Old brain can no longer jump between a major Python project and a new language.

But there's no longer any need to jump!

My last Python project is done and I'm formerly retired.
So, on to the fun Elixir learning.
I still have a bunch of videos to watch from the just-concluded ElixirConf2024 in Orlando Florida.
Then, it's on to [Elixir in Action (third Edition)](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition) by Saša Jurić.
Excited to get back into learning then working on my first project.
