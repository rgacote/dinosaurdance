Decided to switch from (A)Mnesia to Ecto with SQLite3 for my NVD (CVE) caching application.

1. The historic NVD data is over 1GB which means I'm already starting to run into limitations.
1. The planned database is _extremely_ simple (two tables?).
1. Experience with Ecto is more important in the long term for planned projects.

Useful and interesting links:
