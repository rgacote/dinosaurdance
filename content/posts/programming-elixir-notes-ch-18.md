An OTP Supervisor manages one or more processes, which can be additional Supervisors.

<!--more-->

1. Start a Supervisor project as follows:
   {{< highlight elixir >}}
   mix new --sup sequence
   {{< /highlight >}}

1. Creates additional files:
   {{< highlight bash >}}
   lib/sequence.ex
   lib/sequence/application.ex
   {{< /highlight >}}

1. The autogenerated `Application` module is explicitly not documented:
   {{< highlight elixir >}}
   @moduledoc false
   {{< /highlight >}}


## OTP-Supervisors-1
Add a Supervisor to the Stack application. [Source](https://github.com/rgacote/ProgrammingElixirExercises/tree/OTP-Supervisors-1/stack)

Changed module name from `Stack` to `Stack.Server`, which it is in the book.
Better defines the module's purpose.

Renamed the project from `otpserver` to `stack` now that it is used across multiple chapters.
